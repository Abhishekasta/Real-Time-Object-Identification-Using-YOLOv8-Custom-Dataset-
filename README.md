# Overview-

This project implements real-time object identification using the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) model, trained on a custom dataset. The system is designed to detect and classify objects in a live video feed with high accuracy and minimal latency.

# Features

. Custom Dataset Integration: The YOLOv8 model is trained on a dataset tailored to specific objects, ensuring high precision in detection.

. Real-Time Processing: Achieves real-time object detection with low latency, making it suitable for time-sensitive applications.

. High Accuracy: Utilizes advanced training techniques and algorithms to deliver reliable object identification.

. Scalable Design: Easily extendable to include additional objects and categories as needed.

. Robust Performance: Functions effectively in various environmental conditions and scenarios.
